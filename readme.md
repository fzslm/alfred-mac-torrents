# alfred-mac-torrents
Alfred workflow that downloads torrents from MacTorrent. Based on Sergey Baranov's [original workflow](https://github.com/gemoroy/alfred-mac-torrents).

Heavily based on the original workflow, but this one opens torrents directly in your torrent application instead of opening them in the browser. 

## Install

See Releases tab.

*Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 4+ and the Alfred [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).*

## Usage

In Alfred, type `mtd`, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and your query.
